ADVANCED PROGRAMMING. MINIPROJECT 4. Recursion and Pure Data Structures
Andrzej WÄ…sowski 2015

Read the paper Hinze and Paterson on "Finger trees: a simple general-purpose
data structure". Solve the preparatory exercises before starting to work.  They
are designed to flatten the learning curve (easy).

Read the entire task description before starting to work.  The task consists of
two parts.  First, preparing a single Scala file to be handed in. Second,
answering an experimental question.

We train the following skills during this exercise:

- Reimplementing some design based on a description in a research paper in the
  area of data structures
- Implementing persistent pure data structures without pointer/reference manipulation (obviously).
- Using polymorphic recursions, and advanced types to enforce complex properties.
- Property testing a new kind of data operations.

QUESTION I. Implementing Finger trees (70%)
================================

Implement Finger Trees by completing the implementation in FingerTree.scala.  I
recommend that you do not fill in the file top-down, but rather do it in the
order in which things are explained in the paper.  So I suggest to read
sections 1--3, and fill in Scala implementations as you go.

The FingerTreeSpec.scala file has some tests.  These tests will work if you
will complete the generators of FingerTree structures.  Feel free to add more
tests, if you spot some other properties.  Your hand-in will be tested on
slightly more tests than those included here.

In both files large parts are commented out, since initially, before you fill
in the gaps the files would not compile. You need to uncomment new parts in
each of the files as you proceed.

My entire implementation for Finger Trees was below 250 lines (including the
large comment for Question II).  The generators for Finger Trees test cases
took 10-20 lines in total.  Once you add the tests, the Spec file will about
double in size.  If you are seriously above this, you are likely off track. Ask
for help.

QUESTION II. Evaluation (30%)
============================

Read the question in the bottom of FingerTree.scala.  Answer in the same Scala
file, in a comment. Notice, that this question may take more time than in the
previous weeks.
